High School Coding Project On Music Synthesis For Strings

This repository documents most of my programs made to help achieve my goal of improving synthesizers for string instruments. I apologize for how messy my code is, but I thought this would be a great way to demonstrate what my code actually looks like (including the weird variable names, naming conventions, trials, errors, and attempts at getting ChatGPT to help)
